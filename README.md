Simple application to convert a selected database table to class

- Support Sql Server as database source
- Convert to C# class
- New data sources and language support to be added

#### Dependencies
- @rvegajr - https://github.com/rvegajr/Pluralize.NET.Core For pluralization/singularazation used when generating class.
- I removed the highlighting dependency and created a simple tokenizer to be used as class highlighter.

#### Plans
- Adding connection manager
- Highlight theme manager
- Adding multiple language support
